Part of my job at NPRI is to make public records requests for salary
information from state agencies in Nevada.  The records are then
posted on http://transparentnevada.com/.

Some agencies in the state have antiquated payroll systems that
prevent them from exporting the records I request in a modern,
spreadsheet-like format.

Therefore, I have to write scripts that consume a textfile and output
the data contained therein to a format more "spreadsheet ready."

These are those scripts.

Enjoy.
